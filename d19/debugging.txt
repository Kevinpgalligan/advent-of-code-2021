### Figuring out why scanners don't overlap
This says sample 4 doesn't overlap with sample 1, but that contradicts the example.

CL-USER> (let ((Ss (load-scanners "/home/kg/proyectos/advent/d19/sample")))
	   (loop for Si in Ss
		 for i = 0 then (1+ i)
		 do (progn
		      (format t "scanner ~a integrates with scanners: " i)
		      (loop for Sj in Ss
			    for j = 0 then (1+ j)
			    do (when (integrate-scanner Sj (list Si))
				 (format t "~a " j)))
		      (terpri))))
scanner 0 integrates with scanners: 0 1 
scanner 1 integrates with scanners: 0 1 3 
scanner 2 integrates with scanners: 2 4 
scanner 3 integrates with scanners: 1 3 
scanner 4 integrates with scanners: 2 4 
NIL
